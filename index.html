        <p1> Hello! My name is Maya Swan, a junior computer science student from PG County, Maryland. <br>
             I have a younger sister and an adorable dog who just turned one last month. <br> I am looking
             forward to this semester, in particular GHOE and my active organizations which include
             Association for Computing Machinery and Verge Modeling Troupe. I am currently the Miss ACM for this academic school year.
