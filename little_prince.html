<br> As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.

<p1> I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. </p1>

<p2>It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. </p2>

In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead,
his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:

<p3>"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible...‚Äù </p3>

<br> As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again:

<p4>"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty
to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of
a lamp, even when he is asleep. . ." </p4>

And I felt <br> him to be more fragile still.

<p5>I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a
little puff of wind. . .</p5>
